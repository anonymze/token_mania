# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TanStack Start application built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite. It's a full-stack React framework that supports server-side rendering and server functions.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `pnpm dev` (runs on port 3000)
- **Build application**: `pnpm build`
- **Package manager**: pnpm (specified in packageManager field)

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **TanStack Start**: Full-stack React framework with SSR capabilities
- **TanStack Router**: File-based routing system with type-safe navigation
- **React 19**: Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable React components
├── routes/             # File-based routing (TanStack Router)
│   ├── __root.tsx     # Root layout component
│   └── index.tsx      # Home page route
├── router.tsx         # Router configuration
└── routeTree.gen.ts   # Auto-generated route tree (do not edit)
```

### Key Patterns

**Server Functions**: Use `createServerFn()` for server-side logic that can be called from client components. Server functions support method specification (GET/POST) and validation.

**Route Definition**: Routes use `createFileRoute()` pattern with loaders for data fetching and components for rendering.

**Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` for imports.

**File System**: The application uses Node.js file system operations via server functions for persistent data (e.g., count.txt).

### Generated Files
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated by TanStack Router - do not manually edit
- Route changes require router regeneration (typically handled by dev server)
